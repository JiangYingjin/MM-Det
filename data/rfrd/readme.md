# Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset

Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset (RFRD) contains 38k image-text paired conversations on 1921 real frames and 3579 fake frames, with each description generated from Gemini v1.5 pro for forgery analysis. Real videos are from Youtube, while fake ones are generated by [Stable Video Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models). The dataset can be achieved at [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1buMlUlmxpBfmmF00eXMkzvdJKIXEApvw?usp=sharing)

`rfrd.json` contains the overall descriptions, while `rfrd_train.json` is a subset which only contains all training data without validation data to avoid data leakage.
