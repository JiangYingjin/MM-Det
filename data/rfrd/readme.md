# Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset

To finetune large multi-modal models on forgery detection, we construct a text-image paired description dataset called Rich Forgery Reasoning Dataset. This dataset contains 38k conversations on 1921 real frames and 3579 fake frames, with each description generated from Gemini v1.5 pro for forgery analysis. Real videos are from Youtube, while fake ones are generated by [Stable Video Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models). The original frames can be extracted from `youtube` and `stablevideodiffusion` in DVF.

Based on these descriptions, we build up an instruction-based dataset for fine-tuning. This dataset contains up to 38k conversations on 5,500 images, which can be achieved at [rfrd](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1buMlUlmxpBfmmF00eXMkzvdJKIXEApvw?usp=sharing).

`rfrd.json` contains the overall descriptions, while `rfrd_train.json` is a subset which only contains all training data without validation data to avoid data leakage.

#### Data Structure

Each element contains an image with a conversation based on forgery detection and reasoning. Please set the data root as `$RECONSTRUCTION_DATASET_ROOT` in [Reconstruction Dataset](#reconstruction-dataset), then the path in `image` refers to the corresponding image.

              "value": "The image is likely a spoof image because the unnatural pose of the person in the red shirt suggests that the image has been manipulated.  It is possible that the image was created by combining different images to create a humorous or surreal scenario."
